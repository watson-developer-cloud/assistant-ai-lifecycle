# Contributing

We welcome contributions!

To contribute to our project, fork and clone it, create a branch, and submit a pull request. Here's a good [set of instructions](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/).

Make sure you read our [template instructions](./contributing/TEMPLATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md), [coding standards](./contributing/CODING_STANDARDS.md) and [pull request process](./contributing/PULL_REQUESTS.md) before submitting code.

Does your code show up in another IBM offering or is part of an IBM contracted services engagement? If it does, that's not necessarily a problem, we just need to know. Because this code can end up in our commercially licensed cloud and on premise offerings, we need a bit of process. We need to be sure of the provenance of your contribution and that we have the ability to use it and redistribute it.
## Intellectual Property

We take intellectual property seriously. We need to be sure of the provenance of your contribution and that we have the ability to include it in our project and redistribute it under our open source [license](../LICENSE). When you submit your PR, you're asserting that you have authored all of the code in the PR and that you have the right to contribute it to our project.
