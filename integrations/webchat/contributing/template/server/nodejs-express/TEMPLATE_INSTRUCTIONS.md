# Template instructions for server/nodejs-express

This template uses a simplified version of the Express starter kit as its base. It provides the ability to import routes and some basic error fallback behavior. The entry point is [server.js](server.js) and the server listens on port 3001.

## Using this template

1. Search for TODO in the example folder and replace with appropriate content.
2. Add your own routes to `http://localhost:3001/api/` as needed in [/routes/api](/routes/api).
3. Delete this file.
