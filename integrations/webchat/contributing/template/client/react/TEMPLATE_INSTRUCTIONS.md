# Template instructions for client/react

This template is based off of a simplified version of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev). The entry point is [src/index.js](src/index.js) and the server listens on port 3000. By default, requests are [proxied](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) to `http://localhost:3001` to avoid CORS issues if you are using a server for this example. You can edit this in [package.json](package.json). This project also makes use of the [@ibm-watson/assistant-web-chat-react](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-web-chat-react) to load web chat.

## Using this template

1. Delete the unneeded application files.
2. Search for TODO in the example folder and replace with appropriate content.
