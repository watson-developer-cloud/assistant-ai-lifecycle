# Template instructions for client/javascript

This template is based off of a simple inline javascript example inside an html file that is intended to be opened directly in a web browser with the need to host it on a server. If you need the file to be hosted or for a more complex example, use the `javascript-with-build` template.

## Using this template

**NOTE: You should only use the `javascript-with-build` or the `javascript` example, not both.**

1. Search for TODO in the example folder and replace with appropriate content.
2. Delete the existing [javascript-with-build][../javascript-with-build] folder.
3. Delete this file.
