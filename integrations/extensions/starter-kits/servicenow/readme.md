# ServiceNow Incident Report

## Background


ServiceNow is a cloud-based software platform for IT Service Management (ITSM) which helps to automate IT Business Management.
It has a variety of functionalities, however this extension will focus on Incident management, specifically creating an Incident.

This starter kit focuses on the [ServiceNow Table API](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/sandiego/rest/c_TableAPI), and specifically on using `POST /now/table/{tableName}` where `tableName` is `incident`.

This extension is also described in the following [blog](update link).

## Pre-Requisite Steps

An instance is required to use ServiceNow APIs. Luckily, ServiceNow offers a Personal Developer Instance, well-suited for testing and demos. Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/rome/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_buildmyfirstapp_rome_personal_developer_instances) to create an account and provision a Personal Developer Instance.
### Auth Info
The ServiceNow API requires authentication. To obtain the login credentials to your Developer Instance, follow the following steps:

1. At the top menu bar click on `All`
2. On the filter, type in `User` and go to `System Security`->`Users and Groups`. 
3. Under `UserID`, search for `admin`. This should look similar to: <br>
![configure-user](../servicenow/assets/ConfigureUser.png)
Click on the `admin` search result, then:
   - Change the email to your personal email 
   - Check the `Password needs reset` box
   - Click on `Update`
   - Logout
   - Try to log in with username `admin`. You should see an error banner and be offered reset your password through a link. Set a new password and remember it, as it will be used alongside your username (`admin`) for your Basic Authentication security configuration.

If you encounter any trouble, follow these [guidelines](https://docs.servicenow.com/en-US/bundle/sandiego-platform-administration/page/administer/security/reference/change-default-credentials.html).

**Tip**: ServiceNow might ask you for your current password. To find it, go to your login avatar to access your account and click `Manage Instance Password`. You wlll see your current password there.

An easy way to test you have made the proper changes within ServiceNow is to use this [Postman collection](../servicenow/assets/sn.postman.json) and call the API. Don't forget to **change the instance name** in the hostname.
