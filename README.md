## AI Lifecycle
We believe that if we can help you leverage all of the capabilities available within IBM watsonx Assistant, you will be able to build highly effective AI assistants for your business. To that end, experts from the IBM watsonx Assistant team have created the [AI lifecycle guide](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/ai-lifecycle) in addition to the open source Python notebooks [Dialog Skill Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-dialog-skill-analysis), [Measure & Analyze Effectiveness Notebooks](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook) that are intended to help you build, manage and incrementally improve your assistant's AI capabilities. The team incorporates expertise gained from real world engagements with clients from around the world. We hope it helps you to discover ways to get the most out of your own AI implementation.

## Integrations
There are many different ways to integrate with IBM watsonx Assistant. This includes many built in channel integrations such as Webchat and Phone but also extends out to many different types of webhooks that can enable all kinds of use cases. The [integrations section](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations) in this repo contains many useful assets that can be downloaded and used to enhance the capabilities of your IBM watsonx Assistant instance. 

## Conversational Skills
Conversational skills enable users to begin _tasks_ and _automations_. In watsonx Orchestrate, users possess the ability to create skill backed actions from a catalog of low-code, out of the box skills. Customers of either watsonx Orchestrate and watsonx Assistant may choose to [register a pro-code Conversational Skill Provider](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/blob/master/conversational-skills/README.md) and create pro-code skills for more complex work flows. The [conversational skills](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/conversational-skills) section in this repo contains examples and an SDK to help create code-based conversational skills.
