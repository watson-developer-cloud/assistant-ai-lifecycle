## AI Lifecycle
We believe that if we can help you leverage all of the capabilities available within Watson Assistant, you will be able to build highly effective AI assistants for your business. To that end, experts from the Watson Assistant team have created the [AI lifecycle guide](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/ai-lifecycle) in addition to the open source Python notebooks [Dialog Skill Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-dialog-skill-analysis), [Measure & Analyze Effectiveness Notebooks](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook) that are intended to help you build, manage and incrementally improve your assistant's AI capabilities. The team incorporates expertise gained from real world engagements with clients from around the world. We hope it helps you to discover ways to get the most out of your own AI implementation.
